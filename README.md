## Recent work

<!-- work starts -->
- **[A whiteboard that draws for you](https://legrand.design/work/draw-ai-canvas)** - October 29, 2025
  - I wasn't totally happy with existing drawing tools, so I built one that generates complete layouts from natural language. Draw.cafe combines AI-powered canvas generation with traditional design tools to skip the tedious parts of visual design.
- **[An agent that actually understands your codebase](https://legrand.design/work/augment-agent)** - April 02, 2025
  - How we solved the context problem that makes most AI coding assistants useless in real codebases, creating an agent that can work with 100k+ file repositories.
- **[Predicting your next edit](https://legrand.design/work/next-edit)** - February 19, 2025
  - Next Edit extends code completions beyond the cursor and across your entire workspace. It understands what you're trying to accomplish and works in the background to suggest edits that help you complete your tasks more quickly and comprehensively.
- **[Building a context engine for real codebases](https://legrand.design/work/augment)** - October 15, 2024
  - How we built Augment's Context Engine to solve the fundamental problem that makes most AI coding assistants fail in production: understanding what matters in repositories with 100k+ files.
- **[Building software together](https://legrand.design/work/replit-teams)** - July 20, 2024
  - A suite of collaborative tools that brings the natural feel of Google Docs and Figma to software development, enabling teams to build and ship together in real time.
- **[Tools for the next generation of software developers](https://legrand.design/work/replit)** - July 16, 2024
  - Today, comparatively few people build software the rest of the world uses.
- **[Idea to app, fast](https://legrand.design/work/replit-agent)** - July 16, 2024
  - Replit Agent is an AI system that can create and deploy applications from idea to deployment in just minutes, revolutionizing how developers build software.
- **[AI for software development](https://legrand.design/work/replit-ai)** - May 20, 2024
  - Designing workspace-aware AI that understands your codebase through context hierarchies, inline edits, and agentic workflows
- **[Better version control, without reinventing git](https://legrand.design/work/replit-projects)** - April 14, 2024
  - How we built version control that feels native to real-time collaboration, adopting trunk-based development and code review workflows without reinventing git.
- **[Figma to Code](https://legrand.design/work/figma-to-code)** - February 14, 2024
  - A Figma plugin that transforms designs into production-ready React projects on Replit. Built during Hack Week to streamline the journey from design to deployed prototype in seconds.
- **[Build anything without code](https://legrand.design/work/bubble)** - March 10, 2021
  - Bubble is the world's most powerful no-code platform. The Maison design system transformed its editor experience, enabling rapid customer growth.
- **[Data-driven care for injectable medicine](https://legrand.design/work/gocap)** - April 24, 2019
  - Common Sensing succeeded in bringing a novel smart hardware device from concept to market in a difficult space.
